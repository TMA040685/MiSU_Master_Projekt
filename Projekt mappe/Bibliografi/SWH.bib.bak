  Abstract                 = {Many state and federal governments have mandated in such documents as the National Science Education Standards that inquiry strategies should be the focus of the teaching of science within school classrooms. The difficult part for success is changing teacher practices from perceived traditional ways of teaching to more inquiryâ€?based approaches. Arguments are often made about the effectiveness of these traditional strategies. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the inquiryâ€?based approach known as the Science Writing Heuristic approach as a treatment to traditional teaching practices on students' postâ€?test scores in relation to students' achievement level and teacher's implementation of the approach. A mixedâ€?method research approach was used to analyze the teacher observational data and students' test results. The major findings of this study are that the quality of the implementation does have an impact on student performance on postâ€?test scores and that highâ€?quality implementation of the Science Writing Heuristic approach has significant advantages in closing the achievement gap within science classrooms.},

The sample of the study was 54 university students registered at elementary school mathematics education department. While the experimental group was asked to conduct WTL activities like explanatory writing, the teachers in the control group carried on their classes with traditional methods like questioning. Conceptual discussions were made during the instruction in both groups. The data of the study were gathered by Electrostatics Conceptual Test. The data were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results of the study showed that there was a significant difference between the levels of improvement of conceptual understanding in groups favoring the experimental group. It was suggested that writing-based activities should be used to improve the conceptual understanding of students in numerical calculation-based courses like physics and mathematics.},

  Abstract                 = {Teaching science to secondary students in an online environment is a growing international trend. Despite this trend, reports of empirical studies of this phenomenon are noticeably missing. With a survey concerning the nature of laboratory activities, this study describes the perspective of 35-secondary teachers from 15-different U.S. states who are teaching science online. The type and frequency of reported laboratory activities are consistent with the tradition of face-to-face instruction, using hands-on and simulated experiments. While provided examples were student-centered and required the collection of data, they failed to illustrate key components of the nature of science. The features of student-teacher interactions, student engagement, and nonverbal communications were found to be lacking and likely constitute barriers to the enactment of inquiry. These results serve as a call for research and development focused on using existing communication tools to better align with the activity of science such that the nature of science is more clearly addressed, the work of students becomes more collaborative and authentic, and the formative elements of a scientific inquiry are more accessible to all participants.},

The tool, called the science writing heuristic, can be used by teachers as a framework from which to design classroom activities. Theoretically, the science writing heuristic represents a bridge between traditional laboratory reports and types of writing that promote personal construction of meaning. Two eighthâ€?grade classes participated in using the science writing heuristic during an 8â€?week stream study. The teacher and one of the researchers collaboratively developed activities based on the science writing heuristic that the teacher implemented. Nineteen target students were studied in depth. Characteristics of report writing and students' understanding of the nature of science were investigated, using interpretive techniques. There is evidence that use of the science writing heuristic facilitated students to generate meaning from data, make connections among procedures, data, evidence, and claims, and engage in metacognition. Students' vague understandings of the nature of science at the beginning of the study were modified to more complex, rich, and specific understandings. The implications of the study for writing in science classrooms is discussed.},

Students in the treatment group were instructed by the SWH approach, while those in the comparison group were instructed with traditionally designed chemistry instruction. Tests measuring studentsâ€™ conceptual understanding in the units of chemical change and mixture were administered as pre- and posttest for both groups. At the end of the instruction, semistructured interviews were conducted with 13 students from the treatment group and eight students from the comparison group. ANCOVA results revealed that the SWH approach was superior to the traditional approach on studentsâ€™ understanding of chemical change and mixture concepts. Interview results indicated that students in the treatment group demonstrated better scientific understanding of chemical change and mixture concepts compared to those in the comparison group.},

  Abstract                 = {Artiklen belyser pÃ¥ baggrund af fire nyere sammenfatninger af empirisk forskning spÃ¸rgsmÃ¥letom hvorvidt undersÃ¸gelsesbaseret naturfagsundervisning er en effektiv pÃ¦dagogisk strategi mÃ¥ltpÃ¥ elevernes naturfaglige lÃ¦ring. FÃ¸rst prÃ¦senteres en rÃ¦kke argumenter for og imod inquiry-basedscience education (IBSE), og dernÃ¦st forklares idÃ©en med reviews som metaanalyser som baggrundfor prÃ¦sentationen af de fire reviews. Resultaterne viser blandt andet at undersÃ¸gelsesbaseret naturfagsundervisninghar en positiv effekt pÃ¥ elevernes lÃ¦ring hvis aktiviteterne er lÃ¦rerstÃ¸ttede, og hvisde kombinerer kognitive, epistemiske og sociale elevaktiviteter. Men de viser ogsÃ¥ at undervisningsaktiviteterder sÃ¦tter naturfaget ind i en sammenhÃ¦ng, og lÃ¦rernes spÃ¸rgende kommunikation derfremmer elevernes synlige tÃ¦nkning, har endnu stÃ¸rre betydning.Based on four reviews of empirical research, this paper focuses on the question: Do we have evidencefor Inquiry-Based Science Education (IBSE) as an effective pedagogical strategy considering scienceachievements of students? As a background for the findings pro and con, arguments about IBSE arepresented and methodological problems in doing meta-analyses are introduced. The analyses showthat IBSE can have a positive effect if the activities are teacher guided, and if cognitive, epistemicand social student activities are integrated. But research also shows that if science activities areintroduced in a context, and if the teachers ask questions that promote visible thinking in students,the effects are even higher.}

  abstract = {Despite some limitations, Cronbach's coefficient alpha remains the most widely used measure of scale reliability. The purpose of this article was to empirically document the magnitudes of alpha coefficients obtained in behavioral research, compare these obtained values with guidelines and recommendations set forth by individuals such as Nunnally (1967, 1978), and provide insights into research design characteristics that may influence the size of coefficient alpha. Average reported alpha coefficients ranged from .70 for values and beliefs to .82 for job satisfaction. With few exceptions, there were no substantive relationships between the magnitude of coefficient alpha and the research design characteristics investigated.},
